only approved users should be able to create showtimes.

deployments to the test bot blow away the data.

docker containers
--
15:22 <@infinitehazlep> i can run docker containers
15:22 <@infinitehazlep> idk about exposing my box externally though, i need to learn 
                        more about how that works to see if it's something i'm 
                        comfortable with
15:23 <@infinitehazlep> fortunately the data is p unimportant lol, usually we're only 
                        looking at a couple of movies in a week
15:23 < jade36> i can ship you a docker container, methinks. that'd be entertaining 
                to add.
15:23 < jade36> or i can ship you a way to build your own docker container
15:24 < jade36> if you want to learn that
15:24 <@infinitehazlep> i would!

ideal vision
--
15:09 <@infinitehazlep> so like my ideal vision of this would be that it also 
                        operates in main to be able to advertise showtimes, running 
                        the countdown function that breaks shale and the echo 
                        function that's been restricted because of shenanigans. but i 
                        haven't been privy to any of the conversations around 
                        restricting that echo feature or anything so i'm just wishing 
                        out loud lol
15:10 <@infinitehazlep> i'm just mentioning that stuff now while we're figuring stuff 
                        out
15:10 <@infinitehazlep> if it's just running here then it looks p close to 
                        operational as is!
15:10 <@chickenhips> i'll talk to da mods about allowing the new cinema bot in main
